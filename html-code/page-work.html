        <h2>Boviwalk</h2>
        <div class="title-line"></div>
        I joined Boviwalk in its early stages and worked on a wide variety of tasks. We built most systems from the ground up, transitioning from literature research to a production-ready system. Being part of a very small company, I had a lot of responsibility and was directly responsible for key parts. Here is a list of my main contributions:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="semibold">Cow BB, Segmentation, and Keypoint Detection</span><br>Developed a full labeling pipeline, dataset creation, advanced image augmentation, model training, iterative re-training system, model evaluation, and model deployment.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="semibold">Cow tracking and Eartag Matching</span><br>Designed and implemented a custom tracking algorithm with live eartag mapping</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="semibold">Custom Video Lameness Detection Model</span><br>Managed professional labeling, intelligent label preprocessing, dataset creation, video augmentation, prototyping model architectures, model training, model evaluation, and model integration</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="semibold">Fence Removal, Image Inpainting</span><br>Created semi-automatic fence segmentation, dataset creation, model training, model evaluation, and model integration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Region Hovedstadens Psykiatri </h2>
        <div class="title-line"></div>
        At Region Hovedstadens Psykiatri, I contributed to three major projects. Due to confidentiality concerns, I am unable to provide specific details, but here are my main contributions:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="semibold">Text Processing</span><br>Developed a complex program (~5000 lines) to efficiently clean, predict, replace, and categorize millions of text lines. The reliability of the output was crucial, so a significant part of the project involved creating systems to ensure correctness.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="semibold">In-House GUI</span><br>Created an interactive GUI that could be used to report and plot data. The program also included a sophisticated backup system, which had to be implemented locally due to privacy concerns. The GUI was designed for use by non-technical people, so it was distributed as a single executable.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="semibold">Web Scraper</span><br>As part of a research project, I was tasked with creating a fault-tolerant web scraper that could be used continuously. A major challenge of this project was to ensure the integrity of the data despite the potential for changes in the underlying web pages, such as layout modifications.</li>
        </ul>
